fun main() {
    val a: Int = 1  // immediate assignment
    val b = 2   // `Int` type is inferred
    val c: Int  // Type required when no initializer is provided
    c = 3       // deferred assignment
    println("a = $a, b = $b, c = $c")
}

// conclusion: 
// immediate assignment does not need to give type
// we need to give type if the variable is not initialized
